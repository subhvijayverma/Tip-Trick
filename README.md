1. Install the Required Modules
Run the following commands one by one in your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or VS Code terminal):

pip install speedtest-cli

pip install matplotlib

pip install numpy

pip install tkintertable  # Only if tkinter is missing (usually comes pre-installed)


Important: The correct package is speedtest-cli, but it is imported as speedtest in code.



Install the Correct Module
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

pip install speedtest-cli


or, if using Python 3 specifically:


pip3 install speedtest-cli


Step 2: Verify Installation
After installation, check if it is installed correctly:

pip show speedtest-cli


It should display the package details.

Step 3: Run Your Script Again
Once installed, rerun your script:

python "f:\python\trick and tech\speed meter"

Step 4 (Optional): If Still Fails
Ensure you are using the same Python environment where the module was installed.
If using VS Code or any IDE, check that the correct interpreter is selected.
Try:

python -m pip install speedtest-cli
